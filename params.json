Over time I'll complete it by adding more tracking options to fully exploid the extension.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n* Adobe Air SDK 3.5 or later\r\n* XCode IDE, iOS SDK 5.1 or later\r\n* Google Android SDK 2.2\r\n\r\nAdd the _FlashRuntimeExtensions.h_ file from the Adobe Air SDK to the _source/ios/Libraries_ folder  \r\nAdd the _FlashRuntimeExtensions.jar_ file from the Adobe Air SDK to the _source/android/libs_ folder  \r\nIn the **build** folder, make a copy of the _user.properties.eg_ file and call it _user.properties_  \r\nEdit that file to provide values specific to your system  \r\nUse the `build.ant` ant script you'll find in the **build** folder, to build the project\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute to the project refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document for guidelines.\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\nYou can follow the project planning on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/wk7wHEhS), you can even vote for the tasks that are more important for you and you'll like to see implemented.","google":"UA-48485308-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
